## Tableau Project Overview
For this project, we’ll be taking tableau sample data sets superstore as our dataset, which you can download from here. But before moving forward, let’s go through the requirements you need to fulfill for this project. 

## General Requirements
Below are some of the requirements that are generally expected from every dashboard:

Your dashboard size should be 1250px(width) by 720px(height).
Must not have more than 5 containers. However, using them at all is completely optional. 
Every filter must have some padding.
There should be proper formatting.
